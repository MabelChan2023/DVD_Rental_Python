# DVD rental analysis using python
# Objectives
This project aims to create insight graphs on the DVD Rental database using SQL and Python. 6 analyses are included as follows:

1. Time-series plot showing daily total revenue for Canada, France, and United States 

2. Sentiment analysis on movie descriptions using RoBERTa-based model from <a href = "https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest">here</a>
   
3. Visual on how much revenue is coming from different countries to the DVD store

4. Analysis of which actors are bringing in the most revenue (top 10 ranked)

5. Classify countries into low / medium / high categories based on total revenue

6. Merge that new data-frame from Q5 with a dataframe from the dvd db, that gives the countries, so now countries are connected with their classification
