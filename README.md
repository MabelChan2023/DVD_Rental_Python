# DVD rental analysis using python
# Objectives
This project aims to create insight graphs on the DVD Rental database using SQL and Python. 6 analyses are included as follows:

1. Time-series plot showing daily total revenue for Canada, France, and United States 

2. Sentiment analysis on movie descriptions
   
3. Visual on how much revenue is coming from different countries to the DVD store

4. Analysis of which actors are bringing in the most revenue (top 10 ranked)

5. Classify some different countries into some categories

6. Merge that new data-frame from the last step with a dataframe from the dvd db, that gives the countries, so now countries are connected with their classification
